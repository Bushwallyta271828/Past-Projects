## Past-Projects

Notes to self:

* Insert USACO challenge descriptions
* Insert sections in this read-me that explain what each folder is doing here.
* Insert repository of papers read (that was another github I think)
* Insert MNIST things
* Reference that previous BCO code is available in other repository.
