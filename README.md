# Past-Projects

Notes to self:

* Insert USACO challenge descriptions
* Insert repository of papers read (that was another github I think)
* Insert MNIST things
* Reference that previous BCO code is available in other repository.

## USACO Sample

* These are my submissions to the third USA Computer Olympiad competition of the 2016-2017 season. The problem statements are included in each sub-folder.

## Grid of 1s

* This code was written in response to a computer science challenge from David Lerner. The challenge was to take a grid of 0s and 1s and find how many different rectangles were filled only with 1s. I managed to find an algorithm which solved the problem in O(nm) time for an n by m grid.

## Thing
