# Past-Projects

Notes to self:

* Insert repository of papers read (that was another github I think)
* Insert MNIST things
* Reference that previous BCO code is available in other repository.

## USACO Sample

These are my submissions to the third USA Computer Olympiad competition of the 2016-2017 season. The problem statements are included in each sub-folder.

## Grid of 1s

This code was written in response to a computer science challenge from David Lerner. The challenge was to take a grid of 0s and 1s and find how many different rectangles were filled only with 1s. I managed to find an algorithm which solved the problem in O(nm) time for an n by m grid.

## Speech Recognition Project

This was a project I once worked on for David's brother. I was given a large number of sound files of people saying single words and I had to identify the word and identify the milisecond when the word was first spoken. In the end, this proved rather problematic, and I do not believe the most recent version of the code (the one here) is working properly. 

## Schedule Management Code

This is a code project I built myself to try to get control over my schedule. For several years, I recorded in text files every subject I did and when I did it. For example, I could say:

<pre>start Task One @ 13:00</pre>
<pre>stop Task One @ 15:00</pre>
<pre> + 35 minutes Task Two</pre>
<pre>start Task Three @ 17:00</pre>
<pre> - 4 minutes</pre>
<pre>stop Task Three @ 19:00<\pre>

and the program would tell me how many hours I worked that day and on what. In the end, the project got rather elaborate with several tools built to help me analyze my long-term work habits. Sadly, when I changed computer setups, a large part of the funcionality was broken due to badly configured python libraries. 

## Blackrock Castle Observatory Project
