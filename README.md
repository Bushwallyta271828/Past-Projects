## USACO Sample

These are my submissions to the third USA Computer Olympiad competition of the 2016-2017 season. The problem statements are included in each sub-folder.

## Grid of 1s

This code was written in response to a computer science challenge from David Lerner. The challenge was to take a grid of 0s and 1s and find how many different rectangles were filled only with 1s. I managed to find an algorithm which solved the problem in O(nm) time for an n by m grid.

## Speech Recognition Project

This was a project I once worked on for David's brother. I was given a large number of sound files of people saying single words and I had to identify the word and identify the milisecond when the word was first spoken. In the end, this proved rather problematic, and I do not believe the most recent version of the code (the one here) is working properly. 

## Schedule Management Code

This is a code project I built myself to try to get control over my schedule. For several years, I recorded in text files every subject I did and when I did it. For example, I could say:

<pre>start Task One @ 13:00
stop Task One @ 15:00
 + 35 minutes Task Two
start Task Three @ 17:00
 - 4 minutes
stop Task Three @ 19:00</pre>

and the program would tell me how many hours I worked that day and on what. In the end, the project got rather elaborate with several tools built to help me analyze my long-term work habits. Sadly, when I changed computer setups, a large part of the funcionality was broken due to badly configured python libraries. 

## Blackrock Castle Observatory Project

This was a project I did at Blackrock Castle Observatory, Cork, sifting through images of stars looking for exoplanet transits. I worked on two algorithms. The first algorihtm tried to intelligently determine which pixels contained light from the star and which were background, while the second algorihtm looked at the light given off by the star over time to try to group the lightcurve into blocks of similar output. The latter I implemented with a dyamic program to improve the runtime by a factor of the number of images. The code for these two algorithms (dynamic aperture and dynamic blocking, respectively) are contained in the other repositories on my github account:
